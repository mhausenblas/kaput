# kaput

`kaput` is the Kubernetes Attack and Policy Underminer Toolâ€” 
think of it as a toolbox exploiting known weaknesses and vulnerabilities in the Kubernetes control and data plane. In a nutshell, `kaput` coordinates a collection of existing tools to attack Kubernetes clusters and creating a report for the cluster admin to act on.

I plan to use the following to gather candidate attack paths:

- [aquasecurity/kube-hunter](https://github.com/aquasecurity/kube-hunter) 
- [aquasecurity/kube-bench](https://github.com/aquasecurity/kube-bench)
- [banyanops/collector](https://github.com/banyanops/collector)
- [coreos/clair/](https://github.com/coreos/clair/)
- [docker/docker-bench-security](https://github.com/docker/docker-bench-security)
- [nicholasjackson/cnitch](https://github.com/nicholasjackson/cnitch) 
- [OpenSCAP](https://www.open-scap.org/resources/documentation/security-compliance-of-rhel7-docker-containers/)
